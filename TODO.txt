able to select / randomize buildingType (e.g. Log Cabin, Stone Cabin, Plank Cabin, are there more?)
cabin must have <tileX> and <tileY> such that it does not overlap with another <Building>
cabin should have land underneath cleared, this is not automatic
	- It's probably best to wait to implement smart placement of the cabin and require that users have Robin move new cabins. This will be quite tricky to implement.
farmName should match original save file
farmhand money must match save file (potentially totalMoneyEarned as well)
in general there it may be that there are a large number of direct child elements of farmhand that need to be determined from the save file
	- This will require some research ion the game to see how the fields should behave.

DONE: cabin must have unique <uniqueName> consisting of "Cabin" + GUID
DONE: <farmhand> must have <homeLocation> that matches cabin <uniqueName>
DONE: <farmhand> must have unique <UniqueMultiplayerID>
IMPLICIT: each cabin can have exactly one <farmhand>

Extra Info:
farmhand <userID> is linked to steam account
visible x and y cooridnates on farm are approximately from (0,0) to (75, 62)
